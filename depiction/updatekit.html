  <h2>A Note from Mike Beasley</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! Thanks for checking out UpdateKit! I hope you find it useful. If you
    have any suggestions for how to improve on this, feel free to
    <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeBeas">tweet me</a> or
    <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeBeas">tweet the UpdateKit account</a>
    directly, though I may not see those mentions as often as my own.<br />
    <br />
    If you are self-hosting your Shortcut on your own website, be sure to check
    out <a href="../../pubkit">PubKit</a>, which allows you to easily publish
    Shortcuts directly from your iOS device without needing to edit files or
    login to your FTP server.<br />
    <br />
    If you prefer to host your Shortcuts on the
    <a href="https://routinehub.co">RoutineHub</a> service, the
    <a href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/69">RoutinePub</a> Shortcut provides
    an easy way to publish your Shortcuts to the directly from your iOS device.
    I built it in collaboration with the creator of RoutineHub, and it will help
    simplify your Shortcut publishing flow, especially with the
    <a href="#routinehub">UpdateKit 2.0 integration discussed below</a>.<br />
    <br />
    Thanks again for checking this out!<br />
    <br />
    - Mike

  <h2>About UpdateKit</h2>
  <p>
    UpdateKit is a drop-in automatic updater for your Shortcuts. You can call
    UpdateKit from within your own Shortcut to fetch update information and let
    users install updates to your Shortcut.<br />
    <br />
    UpdateKit checks your web server for an Update file that contains metadata
    about the newest version. If the newest version number is higher than your
    Shortcut's current version number, the user will be prompted to install the
    update.<br />
    <br />
    The easiest way to see UpdateKit in action is to
    <a href="/updatekit">download the latest version</a>, edit it in the
    Shortcuts app, change the Current Version value in the Dictionary at the top
    of the workflow, and run it.
